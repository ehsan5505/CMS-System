CMS-System
==========

Design CMS system with the help of bootStrap 3 

## System issues 
System currently have no issues but still it is in beta version, it is purely design on ROR so I hope it will feature issues will be solve as I am practice it more...

### Design Consideration

System is remarkably simple in design point of view, It has a subject which further involve the pages and pages revolve around Section. All of the above content manage by the admin in staff area while public has only view the content.

### Further improvement

Improvement has revolve as I am move toward it later. But I have issues relating to design which will only resolve if I move toward Foundation instead of the BootStrap which is use in this project. For foundation learning take some time so I hope improvement come in next project.
